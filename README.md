# Sovellusohjelmointi 3 lopputy√∂

## version 100
- Starting to do github some projects and issues. I organize the issues to milestones and next thing is starting to build an base of app.
- I am going to use react native framework and i am planning to do 3 different app inside of app.
- I have to figure out the navigation, how to make that.


## version 101
- navigation between components is working. I also made components where is some text to test navigation. I make the navigation with if clauses.
- Issue 1,3,4,5,6 is now complete and lets move to next step.
### Bug:
- Graphics are quite awfull but raw beta application still.
- Missing features
- Missing colors and photos

## version 102
- forecast view is not yet ready. I have to come back to this issue.
- i add some styles to menu and i notice that i have to build databases and use context first, and then i can continue developoing programs features.


## version 103
- I made the JustApp context. There all datahandling happens and there is database and apicalls also. I also plan that we cvan get the forecast based on devices location. I am not sure if the weatherapi allows that.
- Now getting forecast and saving that to database works fine, and i also made some graphics to forecast.

### bug:
- forecast view time stamp wont show correct.
- menu item is too small.
